        <p>I am a Master’s graduate in Mechatronics from TU Hamburg-Harburg, with specialization in Intelligent Systems
          and Robotics.
          Since past two years, I have been working as a Research & Development Engineer at STTech GmbH, located in
          Munich.
          During this time I have worked on different projects such as technical analysis and application of various
          LLMs for automation,
          finetune LLMs in multi-gpu system using aws cli, Automotive SPICE compliant software development and testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          While pursuing my master's, I had the opportunity to work under the Institute of Computational Neuroscience
          (ICNS), UKE – Hamburg (initially as an intern
          and later on as a master thesis candidate), furnished me with the opportunity of working on various medical
          imaging related projects in addition to my master’s thesis. Particularly, projects such as generation of fake
          chest x-ray images with generative adversarial networks (GAN), using reinforcement learning & evolutionary
          algorithms for training agents to play atari games and utilizing transfer learning for MRI brain segmentation.
          These projects, in addition to my master thesis, provided me with a sandbox to implement relatively newer
          concepts such as (VAE)GANs, capsule networks, bio-inspired learning etc. Implementation of some of these
          projects
        </p>
        <p>
          The ICNS also provided me the opportunity of participating in MICCAI (Medical Image Computing and Computer
          Assisted Interventions) challenges in 2018 and 2019. In 2018, my method for MRI based Brain Segmentation was
          ranked 7th. Whereas, in 2019, our team (DAISYLabs) was ranked 1st for Image based Melanoma Detection
          challenge.
